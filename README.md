Create a simple react-native application using redux that contains the following:
3 views that can navigate between each other
1 of those views must contain some form of input where data is captured and state kept (and displayed) between each of the views
E.g. Welcome view where a user has to input their name. This can then be displayed in the top right of every other view for the session.
1 of those views must contain 4 variations of a button shown in the design. The last variation of a button should provide slide event to perform action.  
A native module integration leveraging the bridge that checks on startup whether the app is running on an emulator/simulator. If so, display a notice to the user. The notice message text and styling should be configurable through JS.

**During development please ensure:**
Code quality best practices are adhered to with the view that all code written will have to be maintained in the future.
All source code is checked in and made available through Github.
React Native CLI is used to create project.
